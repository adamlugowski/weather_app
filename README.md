# Weather station

This project involves building a weather station that provides real-time weather data along with air quality indices (smog values) using data from OpenWeatherMap. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and the project utilizes the `pandas` library for data manipulation and `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables.
